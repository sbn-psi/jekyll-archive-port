It concentrated on the discovery and observations of near-Earth asteroids and comets, collectively called near-Earth objects (NEOs). NEAT ended its observations in April 2007. Throughout its history, NEAT utilized three 1m class telescopes - two on the Hawaiian island of Maui (GEODSS and MSSS) and the 1.2m Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, CA. Three unique cameras were developed and used throughout the program. These data are intended to be usable for photometric analysis of the various objects within the NEAT data. Most nights included calibration data, and lists of photometric standard calibration fields.","abstract":null,"citation":"Bauer, J. M. and Lawrence, K. J., Eds., Near Earth Asteroid Tracking V1.0.
