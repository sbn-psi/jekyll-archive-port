This PDS data set represents a compilation of published diameters, optical albedos, near-infrared albedos, and beaming parameters for minor planets detected by NEOWISE during the fully cryogenic, 3-band cryo, post-cryo and NEOWISE-Reactivation Year 1 operations. It contains data covering near-Earth asteroids, Main Belt asteroids, active Main Belt objects, Hildas, Jupiter Trojans, Centaurs, and Jovian and Saturnian irregular satellites. Methodology for physical property determination is described in the referenced articles.","citation":null,"mission":null,"bundleId":"neowise_diameters_albedos","localDocumentsUrl":null,"otherInstrumentsUrl":null,"missionBundleUrl":null,"delivery":null,"location":{"browseUrl":"https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/non_mission/neowise_diameters_albedos_V1_0/document/","downloadUrl":null,"downloadSize":null},"target":null,"pds3":null,"relatedTools":[],"relatedData":[],"publisher":{"name":"NASA Planetary Data System"},"example":{"name":"Bundle Description","url":"https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/non_mission/neowise_diameters_albedos_V1_0/document/bundle_description.txt"}}
