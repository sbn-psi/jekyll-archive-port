Specifically, the data were based on the references in the paper by Samarasinha et al. (2004), i.e. they are those lightcurves, which were used to find out the rotational properties of the comet nuclei (periods, rotation vector coordinates, spin mode, etc.) reported by Samarasinha et al. (2004). These data were migrated from the PDS3 dataset EAR-C-COMPIL-5-LIGHTCURVES-V1.0.","citation":"Melville, K., Ed.; Survey of Comet Lightcurves (PDS4 Format); urn:nasa:pds:compil-comet:lightcurves::1.0; NASA Planetary Data System, 2019.","mission":null,"bundleId":"compil-comet","exampleThumbnailUrl":null,"localDocumentsUrl":null,"otherInstrumentsUrl":null,"missionBundleUrl":null,"published":false,"delivery":null,"location":{"browseUrl":"https://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/pds4-compil-comet-v1.0/lightcurves/","downloadUrl":"https://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/pds4-compil-comet-v1.0/lightcurves/SUPPORT/DOWNLOAD/","downloadSize":"57.3 KB","checksumUrl":"https://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/pds4-compil-comet-v1.0/lightcurves/SUPPORT/CHECKSUM/current.md5"},"target":null,"pds3":{"name":"EAR-C-COMPIL-5-LIGHTCURVES-V1.0","location":{"browseUrl":"https://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/ear-c-compil-5-lightcurves-v1.0/","downloadUrl":"https://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/ear-c-compil-5-lightcurves-v1.0/DOWNLOAD/","downloadSize":"98.7 KB"}},"relatedTools":[],"relatedData":[],"publisher":{"name":"NASA Planetary Data System"},"isDocument":false,"example":{"name":"Example File","url":"#","thumbnailUrl":null},"alternateLocations":[]}
