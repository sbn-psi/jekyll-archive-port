In total 347 companions in 329 systems are included. Data are presented in three tables: one for orbital and physical properties; one for companion designations, discovery information, and reference codes for data values; and one giving full references for each reference code. This data set is complete for binary/multiple components reported through 31 March 2018.","citation":null,"mission":null,"bundleId":"ast_binary_parameters_compilation","exampleThumbnailUrl":null,"localDocumentsUrl":null,"otherInstrumentsUrl":null,"missionBundleUrl":null,"delivery":null,"location":{"browseUrl":"https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/non_mission/ast_binary_parameters_compilation_V2_0/document/","downloadUrl":"https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/non_mission/ast_binary_parameters_compilation_V2_0/document/","downloadSize":"32 KB","checksumUrl":null},"target":null,"pds3":null,"relatedTools":[],"relatedData":[{"name":"Binary Minor Planets Compilation - Data","url":"/resource/binmp/data.html"}],"publisher":{"name":"NASA Planetary Data System"},"example":{"name":"Bundle Description","url":"https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/non_mission/ast_binary_parameters_compilation_V2_0/document/bundle_description.txt","thumbnailUrl":null},"alternateLocations":[]}
